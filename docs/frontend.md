# Partials

Same as [Type Partial](view.md#type-partial), Wallaby utilizes and extends [Template Inheritance](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#template-inheritance) to look for partial in controller and action inheritance chain.

For example, given that Wallaby is mounted under path `/admin` (see how Wallaby is mounted in [route](route.md)), to customize `title` for model `Product`, it goes:

- if the partial is only needed for model `Product` when no controller is created for `Product`, then it can be created as:

  ```
  app/views/admin/products/_title.html.erb
  ```

- if the partial is only needed for the controller created for `Product`, then it can be created as:

  ```ruby
  # app/controllers/backend/goods_controller.rb
  class Backend::GoodsController < Admin::ApplicationsController
    self.model_class = Product
  end
  ```

  ```
  app/views/backend/goods/_title.html.erb
  ```

- if the partial is only needed for the controller created for `Product` and action `index`, then it can be created as:

  ```
  app/views/backend/goods/index/_title.html.erb
  ```

- if the partial is supposed to be shared among the app with base controller (e.g. `Admin::ApplicationController`), then it can be created as:

  ```
  app/views/admin/application/_title.html.erb
  ```

# Stylesheet

There are a couple of ways to customize stylesheet:

- To extend and override Wallaby CSS, the file `app/assets/stylesheets/wallaby/application.scss` can be created with overridden content. For example:

  ```scss
  // app/assets/stylesheets/wallaby/application.scss
  @import 'wallaby/base';

  // Start customization from here
  header {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
  ```

- To inject more CSS libraries to the `<head>` section, it can be written in anywhere in the template/partials as needed as below:

  ```erb
  <% content_for :custom_stylesheet do %>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'theme/new_year' %>
  <% end %>
  ```

  > NOTE: it is possible to use `custom_stylesheet` to add JS libraries as well.

# Javascript

There are a couple of ways to customize javascript:

- To extend and override Wallaby javascript, the file `app/assets/javascripts/wallaby/application.js` can be created with overridden content. For example:

  ```javascript
  // app/assets/javascripts/wallaby/application.js
  //= require wallaby/base

  // Start customization from here
  alert('All is good');
  ```

- To inject more JS libraries to the `<head>` section, it can be written in anywhere in the template/partials as needed as below:

  ```erb
  <% content_for :custom_stylesheet do %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'angular' %>
  <% end %>
  ```

- To inject more JS libraries to the bottom of `<body>` section, it can be written in anywhere in the template/partials as needed as below:

  ```erb
  <% content_for :custom_javascript do %>
    <%= javascript_tag "alert('All is good')" %>
  <% end %>
  ```

# Turbolinks

To enable turbolinks for Wallaby, it is simple as overridding the `app/assets/javascripts/wallaby/application.js` as below:

```javascript
// app/assets/javascripts/wallaby/application.js
//= require wallaby/base

// Start customization from here
//= require turbolinks
```
